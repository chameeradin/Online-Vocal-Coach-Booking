                <p>
                    Singing and music practice is a physical activity inclined to the appeal of aesthetics, art
                    and emotion which may not always be the healthiest for the human body. Singing and
                    music practice may cause temporary and permanent damage by sudden or consistent
                    practice. The student is responsible at all times to practice at his/her own risk and
                    discretion even when instructed.<br>

                    Singing is a physical activity that requires discipline and attention. Noticeable results
                    require patient and constant practice and correction during a long period of time.
                    Practice time will vary depending on the expected goals but noticeable results only
                    happen during a prolonged period of constant and attentive training.<br>

                    Nor VrAd, Rodolfo Gómez Urquiza or any affiliated instructors are responsible for any
                    physical or moral damages caused during sessions or out of them.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center mt-2 py-3">Video Feedback/revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    Video feedback is a low cost approach to a professional vocal coach to get quick
                    advice for a particular interpretation. The vocal coach will do the best in his/her
                    knowledge to assist the performer and to provide tips and guidance for development.<br>

                    Video submission must be 5 minute maximum. If the video would be longer, only the
                    first five minutes will count for revision. Make sure to edit the video before submission
                    to make the most of your time. Package of 5 revisions can only be used with 1 single
                    coach. If you’d like to test different coaches please purchase individual revisions.<br>

                    Keep in mind that one video can not serve as a full diagnose of your technique, be
                    objective on the feedback received. If you’re not convinced about one coach, make
                    sure to select a different one on your next purchase.<br>

                    Videos containing personal information will be discarded and refunds won’t be
                    available. If you would like to get in touch directly with the coach, make sure to make a
                    purchase for private coaching to obtain all his/her information.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-2 py-3 text-info">Expiration of credits</h4>
                <p>
                    Once payment is completed you’ll have one week to submit your video for single video
                    feedback/revision purchases. For packages of 5 you can space your submissions by a
                    week. After 5 weeks all your credits will expire.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-2 py-3 text-info">Refunds and cancelations</h4>
                <p>
                    Refunds and cancelations are not available by any reason. In case of technical
                    problems or missed delivery please notify to info@vocalresults.com within the lapse of
                    one week starting on the day of your purchase.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center mt-2 py-3">Private coaching</h3>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-2 py-3 text-info">Expiration of credits, cancelations and makeups</h4>
                <p>
                    Please note that vocal coaching session have an expiration of a week posterior to the
                    scheduled class since a time slot is reserved for the session. If the student wouldn’t be
                    able to attend the next session he/she must make sure to inform with at least one week
                    of anticipation. In that case, the session will still be charged but a slot will be tried to be
                    accommodated for a make up during that week only. <br>

                    In case there was no space/availability from the instructor for doing the make up, the
                    session will be lost without possibilities of money back. <br>

                    This will only be acceptable once every two months otherwise the fixed schedule will
                    be available again to the public without any security to reserve it for the student. <br>

                    If there is a major incident for absence an effort will be made to schedule a makeup
                    class that same week only and if informed with at least 24 hours of anticipation. This
                    condition will be effective strictly under the availability of the instructor. In case that
                    there would be no possibility to schedule, the class will be marked as missed and charged.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-2 py-3 text-info">Refunds</h4>

                    considered at the price of single lessons and fees of transactions must be covered by
                    the payer. Refunds for single lessons are not an option. Make sure to keep all

                    ups don’t apply to this) and the person in charge of payment will be reimbursed
                    excluding transaction fees. <br>

                </p>
